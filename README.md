### A repository of Jupyter Notebooks on hierarchical bayesian models
- The goal is to summarize and translate into Python relevant pieces from John Kruschke's seminal 2014 text on the topic of Bayesian data analysis.
- We start at chapter 4 and 5 to establish the basics of probability & bayes, and go through various ways to model hierarchical data, estimate posterior distributions over parameters, and compare the evidence for various models (Chapters 7,8,9 and 10).
