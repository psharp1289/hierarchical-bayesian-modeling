### A repository of Jupyter Notebooks on hierarchical bayesian models
- We'll primarily go through John Kruschke's 2014 text on the topic
- We start at chapter 4 and 5 for basic of probability & bayes, and go through various ways to model hierarchical data and estimation of posteriors (Chapters 7,8,9 and 10).
