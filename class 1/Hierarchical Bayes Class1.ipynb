    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to find a distribution that satisfies two conditions for a good 'mathematical description' of the data: (1) The form of the distribution should be \"comprehensible with meaningful parameters\" (Kruschke p.24). (2) the distribution should be \"descriptively accurate\" in that it \"looks like\" the distribution of one's actual data. \n",

The beta distribution has a scale ranging from 0 to 1 (which is the natural range of coin biases) and is defined by two meaningful parameters, $a$ and $a$, that control the prior bias to favor either $\\theta=0$, via an increasing $b$ or favoring $\\theta=1$ via an increasing $a$.\n",
